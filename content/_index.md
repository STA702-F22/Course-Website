### Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to Bayesian statistics targeted towards building a foundation for later research in developing models appropriate to complex data applications and to methodology research developing new modeling/inferential frameworks and algorithms.  Topics include the basic foundations of Bayesian inferences – prior distributions, likelihood functions, posterior  distributions, loss functions, and Bayes estimators/decisions with illustration in simple cases.  Posterior computation in non-conjugate models with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms in addition to approximations to posteriors based on Laplace and variational approaches will be covered.  We will build (and critique) models for a variety of data types and structures including regression, classification, and dependent data,  hierarchical models for the borrowing of information, and methods for dealing with model uncertainty. Throughout we will discuss the difference between classical and Bayesian  paradigms as well as advantages/disadvantages of Bayes. Time permitting we will discuss generalized Bayes. 



### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to

-  Understand the basics of Bayesian inference, that is, be able to define likelihood functions, prior distributions, posterior distributions, prior predictive distributions and posterior predictive distributions.
- Derive posterior distributions, prior predictive distributions and posterior predictive distributions, for common likelihood-prior combinations of distributions.
- Interpret the results of fitted models and conduct checks to ascertain that the models have converged.
- Use the Bayesian methods and models covered in class to analyze real data sets.
- Assess the adequacy of Bayesian models to any given data and make a decision on what to do in cases when certain models are not appropriate for a given data set.

#### Zoom meetings

Occasionally we may need to meet over Zoom for class/lab or Office hours.
The easiest way for you to join the different Zoom meetings is to log in to Sakai, go to the "Zoom meetings" tab, and click "Upcoming Meetings". For the recordings (for lecture/lab and discussion sessions were recorded), also log in to Sakai, go to the "Zoom meetings" tab, and click "Cloud Recordings". Those will be available few minutes after the sessions.
