## Last Class: Normal Means Model

Data Model
`$$Y_i \mid \mu_i, \sigma^2 \overset{iid}{\sim} \textsf(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$$`


Means Model 
`$$\mu_i \mid \mu, \sigma^2_\mu \overset{iid}{\sim} \textsf(\mu, \sigma^2_{\mu})$$` 



Found marginal likelihood `\(\cal{L}(\mu, \sigma^2, \sigma^2_\mu)\)` by integrating out `\(\mu_i\)` with respect to `\(g\)`


`$$\cal{L}(\mu, \sigma^2, \sigma^2_\mu) \propto \prod_{i = 1}^n (\sigma^2 + \sigma^2_\mu)^{-1/2} \exp \left\{ - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left(y_i - \mu \right)^2}{\sigma^2 + \sigma^2_\mu }\right\}$$`







Posterior for `\(\theta = \mu, \sigma^2_\mu\)` with `\(\sigma^2 = 1\)`

`$$\pi(\theta \mid y) = \frac{\pi(\theta) \cal{L}(\theta)}
{\int_\Theta \pi(\theta) \cal{L}(\theta) \, d\theta} =
\frac{\pi(\theta) \cal{L}(\theta)}
{m(y)}$$`



---
##  Stochastic Sampling Intuition

- From a sampling perspective, we need to have a large sample or group of values, `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(S)}\)` from `\(\pi(\theta \mid  y)\)` whose empirical distribution approximates `\(\pi(\theta \mid  y)\)`.

--

-  for any two sets `\(A\)` and `\(B\)`, we want
.block[
.small[
`$$\frac{\dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} \in A}{S}}{\dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} \in B}{S} } = \dfrac{\# \theta^{(s)} \in A}{\# \theta^{(s)} \in B} \approx \dfrac{\pi(\theta \in A \mid  y)}{\pi(\theta \in B \mid  y)}$$`
]
]
--

- Suppose we have a working group `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}\)` at iteration `\(s\)`, and need to add a new value `\(\theta^{(s+1)}\)`.

--

- Consider a candidate value `\(\theta^\star\)` that is  _close_ to `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`.  


--

- Should we set `\(\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star\)` or not?

---
## Metropolis Ratio


look at  the ratio 




$$
`\begin{split}
M &amp; = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star \mid y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} \mid y)} = \frac{\dfrac{p(y \mid \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y)} } {\dfrac{p(y \mid \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})}{p(y)}}\\
\\
&amp;  = \dfrac{p(y \mid \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y \mid \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})}
\end{split}`
$$


--

- does not depend on the marginal likelihood we don't know!




---
## Metropolis algorithm

- If `\(M &gt; 1\)`
  + Intuition: `\(\theta^{(s)}\)` is already a part of the density we desire and the density at `\(\theta^\star\)` is even higher than the density at `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`.
  
  + Action: set `\(\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star\)`

--

- If `\(M &lt; 1\)`, 
  + Intuition: relative frequency of values in our group `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}\)` "equal" to `\(\theta^\star\)` should be `\(\approx M = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star \mid y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} \mid y)}\)`. 
 
--
  + For every `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`, include only a fraction of an instance of `\(\theta^\star\)`.

--
  + Action: set `\(\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^\star\)` with probability `\(M\)` and `\(\theta^{(s+1)} = \theta^{(s)}\)` with probability `\(1-M\)`.



---
## Proposal Distribution


- Where should the proposed value `\(\theta^\star\)` come from? 

--

- Sample `\(\theta^\star\)` close to the current value `\(\theta^{(s)}\)` using a **symmetric proposal distribution** `\(q(\theta^\star \mid \theta^{(s)})\)`

--

- `\(q()\)` is actually a "family of proposal distributions", indexed by the specific value of `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`.

--

- Here, symmetric means that `\(q(\theta^\star \mid \theta^{(s)}) = q(\theta^{(s)} \mid \theta^\star)\)`. 

--

- Common choice 
`$$\textsf{N}(\theta^\star; \theta^{(s)}, \delta^2 \Sigma)$$`
 with `\(\Sigma\)` based on the approximate `\(\textsf{Cov}(\theta \mid y)\)` and `\(\delta = 2.44/\text{dim}(\theta)\)` or tune
 
--

`$$\text{Unif}(\theta^\star; \theta^{(s)} - \delta, \theta^{(s)} + \delta)$$`


---
## Metropolis Algorithm Recap

- The algorithm proceeds as follows:

  1. Given `\(\theta^{(1)}, \ldots, \theta^{(s)}\)`, generate a _candidate_ value `\(\theta^\star \sim q(\theta^\star \mid \theta^{(s)})\)`.
  
--

  2. Compute the acceptance ratio
  .block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
M &amp; = \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\star \mid y)}{\pi(\theta^{(s)} \mid y)} = \dfrac{p(y \mid \theta^\star) \pi(\theta^\star)}{p(y \mid \theta^{(s)}) \pi(\theta^{(s)})}.
\end{split}`
$$
]
]

--

  3. Set
  .block[
.small[
`\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta^{(s+1)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\theta^\star &amp; \quad \text{with probability} \quad \text{min}(M,1) \\
\theta^{(s)} &amp; \quad \text{with probability} \quad 1 - \text{min}(M,1) \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray*}`
]
]

      equivalent to sampling `\(u \sim U(0,1)\)` independently and setting
  .block[
.small[
`\begin{eqnarray*}
\theta^{(s+1)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\theta^\star &amp; \quad \text{if} \quad u &lt; M \\
\theta^{(s)} &amp; \quad \text{if} \quad \text{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right. .
\end{eqnarray*}`
]
]


---
## Metropolis algorithm

- Once we obtain the samples, then we are back to using Monte Carlo approximations for quantities of interest!

--

- we can approximate posterior means, quantiles, and other quantities of interest using the empirical distribution of our sampled values.

--

- easy to compute the posterior distribution of nonlinear functions of parameters!

`$$\psi^{(s)} = g(\theta^{(s)})$$`

--

- some posterior summaries are hard to calculate based on samples `\(\{ \theta^{(s)}\}\)` 

--
  + mode/MAP (at least for continuous)
  
--
  + marginal likelihood  `\(m(y) = \int \pi(\theta) p(y \mid \theta)\, d\theta\)`
---
##  Notes

-  The Metropolis chain ALWAYS moves to the proposed `\(\theta^\star\)` at iteration `\(s+1\)` if `\(\theta^\star\)` has
higher target density than the current `\(\theta^{(s)}\)`.

--

- Sometimes, it also moves to a `\(\theta^\star\)` value with lower density in proportion to the density value itself. 

--

- This leads to a random, Markov process that naturally explores the space according to the probability defined by `\(\pi(\theta \mid y)\)`, and hence generates a sequence that, while dependent, eventually represents draws from `\(\pi(\theta \mid y)\)` (stationary distribution of the Markov Chain).




---
## Convergence

We will not cover the convergence theory behind Metropolis chains in detail, but ...

--

- The Markov process generated under this procedure is **ergodic** (irreducible and aperiodic) and has a unique limiting distribution (stationary distribution)

--

  + ergodicity means that the chain can move anywhere at each step, which is ensured, if `\(q(\theta^\star \mid \theta^{(s)}) &gt; 0\)` everywhere!

--

- By construction, Metropolis chains are **reversible**, so that  `\(\pi(\theta \mid y)\)` is the stationary distribution
  
--

  + Think of reversibility as being equivalent to symmetry of the joint density of two consecutive `\(\theta^{(s)}\)` and `\(\theta^{(s+1)}\)` in the stationary process (which we get by using a symmetric proposal distribution)  
  
  + detailed balance
  




---
## Example

Priors with `\(\sigma^2 = 1\)`:

`$$p(\mu) \propto 1$$`
--

- Use a `\(\textsf{Cauchy}(0,1)\)` prior on `\(\sigma_\mu\)` independent of `\(\mu\)` and 

--

- Symmetric proposal for `\(\mu\)` and  `\(\sigma_\tau\)`?    

--

-  Try independent normals `\(\frac{2.44^2}{d} \textsf{Cov}(\theta)\)` where `\(d\)` is the dimension of `\(\theta\)`  (d = 2)








---
##  First 200 Samples

&lt;img src="08-metropolis-diagnostics-handout_files/figure-html/joint-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


- Overall Acceptance probability is 0.6   out of 10^{4} samples

--

- Goal is around 0.44 in 1 dimension to 0.23 in higher dimensions


---
## Tuning

- Sampled values are correlated

--

- Correlation between samples can be adjusted by selecting an optimal `\(\delta\)` (i.e., spread of the distribution) in the proposal distribution

--

- `\(\delta\)` too small leads to `\(M \approx 1\)` for most proposed values, a high acceptance rate, but very small moves, leading to highly correlated chain.

--

- `\(\delta\)` too large can get "stuck"  because `\(\theta^\star\)` may be very far away from high density regions, leading to a very low acceptance rate and again high correlation in the Markov chain.

--


- Burn-in and thinning can help!



---
## Burn-in

- Convergence  occurs regardless of our starting point (in theory),  so we can usually pick any reasonable values in the parameter space as a starting point.

--

- May take a long time to reach high density regions

--
- Over representation of low density samples given finite iterations

--

- Generally, we throw out a certain number of the first draws, known as the **burn-in**, as an attempt to make our draws closer to the
stationary distribution and less dependent on any single set of starting values. 

--

- However, we don't know exactly when convergence occurs, so it is not always clear how much burn-in we would need.


--

- If you run long enough you should not need to discard any samples!  (ergodicity)







---
## Convergence diagnostics

- Diagnostics available to help decide on number of burn-in &amp; collected samples.

--

- **Note**: no definitive tests of convergence but you should do as many diagnostics as you can, on all parameters in your model.

--

- With "experience", visual inspection of trace plots perhaps most useful approach.

--

- There are a number of useful automated tests in R.

--

- **CAUTION**: diagnostics cannot guarantee that a chain has converged, but they can indicate it has not converged.



---
## Diagnostics in R




- The most popular package for MCMC diagnostics in R is `coda`.

--

- `coda` uses a special MCMC format so you must always convert your posterior matrix into an MCMC object. 

--

- For the example, we have the following in R.
  
  ```r
  #library(coda)
  theta.mcmc &lt;- mcmc(theta,start=1) #no burn-in (simple problem!)
  ```



---
## Diagnostics in R


```r
summary(theta.mcmc)
```

```
## 
## Iterations = 1:10000
## Thinning interval = 1 
## Number of chains = 1 
## Sample size per chain = 10000 
## 
## 1. Empirical mean and standard deviation for each variable,
##    plus standard error of the mean:
## 
##              Mean     SD Naive SE Time-series SE
## mu       -0.07977 0.1046 0.001046       0.002839
## sigma_mu  0.17550 0.1273 0.001273       0.004397
## 
## 2. Quantiles for each variable:
## 
##               2.5%     25%      50%      75%  97.5%
## mu       -0.283420 -0.1508 -0.08193 -0.00848 0.1337
## sigma_mu  0.007995  0.0758  0.15024  0.25228 0.4693
```

The naive SE is the **standard error of the mean**, which captures simulation error of the mean rather than the posterior uncertainty. 

The time-series SE adjusts the naive SE for **autocorrelation**.



---
## Effective sample size

- The **effective sample size** translates the number of MCMC samples `\(S\)` into an equivalent number of independent samples.

--

- It is defined as
.block[
.small[
`$$\textrm{ESS} = \dfrac{S}{1 + 2 \sum_k \rho_k},$$`
]
]

  where `\(S\)` is the sample size and `\(\rho_k\)` is the lag `\(k\)` autocorrelation.
  
--

- For our data, we have
  
  ```r
  effectiveSize(theta.mcmc)
  ```
  
  ```
  ##        mu  sigma_mu 
  ## 1356.6495  838.2613
  ```



--

- So our 10,000 samples are equivalent to 1356.6 independent samples for `\(\mu\)`  and 838.3 independent samples for `\(\sigma_\mu\)`.




---
## Trace plot for mean


```r
plot(theta.mcmc[,"mu"])
```

&lt;img src="08-metropolis-diagnostics-handout_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
## Trace plot for `\(\sigma_\mu\)`


```r
plot(theta.mcmc[,"sigma_mu"])
```

&lt;img src="08-metropolis-diagnostics-handout_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

OK  (be careful of scaling in plots!)



---
## Autocorrelation

- Another way to evaluate convergence is to look at the autocorrelation between draws of our Markov chain.

--

- The lag `\(k\)` autocorrelation, `\(\rho_k\)`, is the correlation between each draw and its `\(k\)`th lag, defined as
.block[
.small[
`$$\rho_k = \dfrac{\sum_{s=1}^{S-k}(\theta_s - \bar{\theta})(\theta_{s+k} - \bar{\theta})}{\sum_{s=1}^{S-k}(\theta_s - \bar{\theta})^2}.$$`
]
]

--

- We expect the autocorrelation to decrease as `\(k\)` increases. 

--

- If autocorrelation remains high as `\(k\)` increases, we have slow mixing due to the inability of the sampler to move around the space well.



---
## Autocorrelation for mean


```r
autocorr.plot(theta.mcmc[,"mu"])
```

&lt;img src="08-metropolis-diagnostics-handout_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

So-So


---
## Autocorrelation for variance 


```r
autocorr.plot(theta.mcmc[,"sigma_mu"])
```

&lt;img src="08-metropolis-diagnostics-handout_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

worse




---
## Gelman-Rubin 

Gelman  &amp; Rubin suggested a diagnostic `\(R\)` based on taking separate  chains with dispersed initial values to test convergence

--
&lt;img src="08-metropolis-diagnostics-handout_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Gelman-Rubin Diagnostic

- Run m &gt; 2 chains of length 2S from overdispersed starting values.
- Discard the first S draws in each chain.
-  Calculate the pooled within-chain variance `\(W\)` and between-chain variance `\(B\)`.

--

.block[
.small[
`$$R = \frac{\frac{S-1}{S} W + \frac{1}{S} B }{W}$$`
]
]

--

- numerator and denominator are both unbiased estimates of the variance if the two chains have converged

--
  +  otherwise `\(W\)` is an underestimate (hasn't explored enough)
  +  numerator will overestimate as `\(B\)` is too large (overdispersed starting points)
  
--

- As `\(S \to \infty\)` and `\(B \to 0\)`,  `\(R \to 1\)`

--

- version in `R` is slightly different 

---
## Gelman-Rubin Diagnostic




```r
theta.mcmc = mcmc.list(mcmc(theta1, start=5000), mcmc(theta2, start=5000))
gelman.diag(theta.mcmc)
```

```
## Potential scale reduction factors:
## 
##          Point est. Upper C.I.
## mu                1          1
## sigma_mu          1          1
## 
## Multivariate psrf
## 
## 1
```

--

-  Values of `\(R &gt; 1.1\)` suggest lack of convergence

--
- Looks OK
 
--

See also `gelman.plot`

---
## Geweke statistic

- Geweke proposed taking two non-overlapping parts of a single Markov chain (usually the first 10% and the last 50%) and comparing the mean of both parts, using a difference of means test

--

- The null hypothesis would be that the two parts of the chain are from the same distribution. 

--

- The test statistic is a z-score with standard errors adjusted for autocorrelation, and if the p-value is significant for a variable, you need more draws. 

---
## Geweke Diagnostic

- The output is the z-score itself (not the p-value).


```r
geweke.diag(theta.mcmc)
```

```
## [[1]]
## 
## Fraction in 1st window = 0.1
## Fraction in 2nd window = 0.5 
## 
##       mu sigma_mu 
##  -0.7779   0.7491 
## 
## 
## [[2]]
## 
## Fraction in 1st window = 0.1
## Fraction in 2nd window = 0.5 
## 
##       mu sigma_mu 
##   0.4454   0.6377
```


---
## Practical advice on diagnostics

- There are more tests we can use: Raftery and Lewis diagnostic, Heidelberger and Welch, etc.

--

- The Gelman-Rubin approach is quite appealing in using multiple chains

--

- Geweke (and Heidelberger and Welch) sometimes reject even when the trace plots look good.

--

- Overly sensitive to minor departures from stationarity that do not impact inferences.

--



- Most common method of assessing convergence is visual examination of trace plots.


---
##  Improving

-  more iterations and multiple chains

--

- thinning to reduce correlations and increase ESS

--

- change the proposal distribution `\(q\)`
